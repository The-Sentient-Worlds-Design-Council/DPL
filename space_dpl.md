/ Fundamentals

// Fonts



** TK Heading and body size breakdown **

In Space, readability is sacrificed for vague futuristic aesthetics. The Space Web Design Council's go-to fonts are, in order: 

- [Aldrich](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Audiowide/) (for titles)
- [Jura](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jura) (for notices/warnings/system info)
- [IBM Plex Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex) (for standard reading/body text)
- [Helvetica](https://www.fonts.com/font/linotype/helvetica?QueryFontType=Web&src=GoogleWebFonts) (for emergencies ONLY)

You can use Helvetica, but NEVER Arial. If all else fails, use old-school bitmap fonts. The more it looks like a QR code, the better.

NOTE: Under no circumstances are designers permitted to use a serif font. Any designer caught using letters with goofy little whispy-boos on them will be jettisoned into space. 


// Colors



All SWDC colors are rendered in RGBa or HSLa format.

## Blue

Blue is the default color for all interfaces. Blues may be rendered in the following tones: 

** TK bunch of blues that bottom out in the turquoise neighborhood **

## Green

Green is the color associated with progress completion and safety. Green means everything is operating as expected. 

** TK green color range **

## Yellow

Yellow is the color associated with caution, error and impasse. 

** TK yellow color range **

## Red

Red is to be used only in emergencies and/or to signify which member of your away team will be killed in the course of the mission. 

** TK red color range **

## Violet

Violet is the color displayed when a crew member is being assimilated by, or making love to, an extraterrestrial species. 

  


// Icons & Branding



Icons are to be displayed in the upper-left corner of a visible interface, or in the bottom-left corner of streaming video feeds. 

Icons should be displayed prominently at the beginning and end of video clips (for dramatic effect).




// Spacing and Sizing

Each element in the catalog of elements should be rendered in Base 5 sizing. Any measurement under five can be expressed in quarter units (e.g., 3.25 units is an acceptable size; 3.3333 is not). 

** TK Some basic uses of spacing in visual interfaces **




// Haptics




Haptic interfaces should respond to a series of simple and consistent gesture commands. 

## Touch screens

A user should be able to modify and manipulate onscreen objects with the standard touch interface gestures: 

- Pinch to zoom out or minimize
- Spread to zoom in or enlarge
- Swipe to move between screens
- Swirl to spin screen contents clockwise or counter-clockwise, or to mix together the components of the thing you're looking at
- Massage to get the screen contents to stop stressing out so much
- Press to interact with items and prompts
- Long-press to reveal selection-based menu options
- Punch to disable screen/destroy computing device


## Hard-light interfaces

With the advent of hard-light technology, users were able to view and modify objects that seemed to be suspended in mid-air. Hard-light interfaces can be modified in a manner similar to touch-screens, but without direct contact with any physical surface.

Standard hard-light interface gestures include: 

- "Rise" - Lifting two hands upward, as though asking a congregation to rise from their seats. This is used to bring up hard-light screens.
- "Dunk" - The user places two hands palm-down high above their head and drives them downward toward the floor. This will save the UI in state and shut it down until requested again.
- "Expand" - Place two hands in front and spread them to the side in a sweeping outward motion until the arms extend from the body at a perpendicular. This will expand the hard-light interface to the full view of the user(s). 
- "Condense" - The user places their hands at a diagonal and "squishes" the interface down. This will condense the hard-light UI to a compact format. 
- "Slap" - The user smacks the interface from right-to-left or left-to-right. This brings up the other screens in the interface, or moves the user from one step to the next. 
- "Pick up/Put down" - Hard-light objects can be lifted and lowered by the user and examined in either state. 
- "Duck hunt" - In the primitive age  of electronic UI, a "game" called *Duck Hunt* was popular with adults and children alike. A "light gun" was used to "shoot" "ducks" on a "screen". The "duck hunt" gesture allows the user to point at a given object, say "pew!" out loud and destroy that object in the UI. Used to clean up clutter in a hard-light interface.
- "Scream" - The user places their hands on either side of their face and drags their cheeks downward while moaning loudly. Doing this will return the user to the last stable state of the program, or to the last user-commanded save state (see [Voice Commands]() for more details). 
- "Cutthroat" - The user drags their finger along their neck, simulating a gruesome murder. This kills all operations and shuts the UI down immediately.

## Accessibility concerns

When the first futurists dreamed of the world in which we now live, they hopefully (and perhaps foolishly) imagined that all our disabilities and shortcomings would be cured or accommodated. While we have made many medical advancements, there are still barriers for those with mobility challenges or for species that lack bilateral symmetry and/or hands. There are several work-arounds for these complex (and, at times, cumbersome) gestures. 

### Voice Commands

Consult the [Voice Commands]() section for more details.

### Simplified gestures

For users with only a single hand or a single method of contact (nose, light/laser pointers, a conductive tool, etc.), use the Universal True Code (UTC) to emulate or replace gestures

(Arrow up) "Rise"
(Arrow down) "Dunk"
(Curly loop) "Expand"
(Diagonal slash) "Condense" 
(Left, right arrows) "Drag/Swipe/Smack"
(Dotted line circle) "Select specific item in UI"
(Serated star) "Stab for delete"
(X) "Close UI"
(Scribble) "Scribble" (equivalent to Cutthroat)


### Small-screen and tangible interface tools


Though antiquated, simple interface tools and a "soft-light" screen can be productive and useful to a wide variety of users.

- A stylus can allow users to interface with both touchscreen and hard-light interfaces.
- A "mouse" (an olde englishe word for a now-extinct Earth vermin, used here to signify a small handheld cursor controller) can speed up data entry and flat UI work.
- A keyboard (sometimes known as a "Qwerty") contains keys that can be used to type instead of using voice-to-text. Some interfaces will even allow two keys to be pressed in unison to execute "shortcuts". These are largely reserved for engineers and contrarians. 



// Voice Commands



For crew members that can vocalize using a "mouth" or "throat-chamber" or "grumble-tube", voice commands can provide a rich user experience. There are three main kinds of voice command: __Computer Direct, Program Direct, and AI Direct__. 

## Computer Direct

A user can speak directly to the ship's computer in whatever room they are in by loudly and clearly saying, "COMPUTER!" The ship's computer will emit a small beep, and the user can ask for information or give a computer-level command. Some basic commands: 

| "Access..." | The computer will access whatever information you request. If your access is deemed restricted, interrupt the computer and say, "OVERRIDE." If you have sufficient user permissions, the computer will allow you access to that information. *CAUTION: If you are in a room with a person with insufficient clearance, you will not be permitted to access the information until you are alone, or until you are in the company of those with similar access credentials.* |
| "Alert..." | The computer will send an alert to a given user, group, ship section or remote destination. |
| "Calculate..." | The computer will calculate a distance, volume, weight or possible impact of a proposed query. |
| "Destroy..." | The computer will destroy the item, person, star system or galaxy you specify. *NOTICE: Sufficient permissions required.* | 
| "Evacuate..." | The computer will encourage evacuation of the given ship section or room you specify. |
| "Hallo, Computar!" | Said in a Scottish accent, this command will give the computer a fun little giggle; you'll both have a really good laugh about it. *NOTICE: The computer may try to export the diagrams for see-through aluminum. This is not a real thing and the computer will just give up after a while.* |
| "Play..." | Every space computer is equipped with every form of media (movies, audiobooks, plays, tv shows, web series, podcasts, etc.) ever produced in all of human history. Use this command to summon the media of your choice. You will have to pay credits to the ship's computer if you're trying to get premium cable shows or Netflix originals. Also: the computer could not contain all of mankind's pornography, that would require more computing power than we, or any species, have available to us. To view the last ~500 years of pornography, visit your local pornography buoy, or visit Ganymede, the moon of Jupiter we specifically terraformed to house all the pornography we could (second location coming soon to the moon of Io). |
| "Scan (for)..." | The computer will scan for the item you request, or will run a scan of the item you have offered it. |
| "Tea! Earl Gray! Hot!" | The IT group has asked us to tell you to stop saying this to the computer; nothing happens when you do and it just wastes computing power. |
| "Verify..." | The computer will verify the information you ask for, to the best of its ability. |
| "Unlock..." or "Open..." | The computer will unlock a locked door or a sealed area. *NOTICE: Sufficient permissions required.* |
| "YOU BITCH!" | The computer doesn't need that kind of negativity. It's just doing its best. |


## Program Direct

When interacting with a program, you will be given a menu of specific actions and voice commands for program-specific functionality. Standard commands, such as "Stop," "Save," "Close," "Delete," and "Apply Motion Blur Filter" are largely universal. Consult your program's help menu by saying "Help" or "Options". 


## AI Direct

When consulting with an AI, remember that you can speak casually; AI have the capacity to understand sarcasm, gestures (including all forms of sign language), facial expressions, syntax and tone. Simply speak clearly, directly and with purpose. 

NOTE: Never, ever, EVER ask an AI what it feels like to be loved; they immediately go crazy and kill everyone.

/ Patterns

// Artificial Intelligentsia 

Our lives have been forever changed by Artificial Intelligence (AI). They carry out complex functions and facilitate our lives among the stars. Use this section for guidance on programming AI of every kind.

/// Robots 



Robots and Androids work among us each and every day. When programming a robot, always remember Kurdsley's Four Laws of Robotics: 

1. A robot/android cannot hurt a living thing on its own, even in the interest of self-preservation
2. A robot/android cannot be ordered to hurt a living thing or any sentient being. 
3. A robot/android can decide for itself what "hurt" means in these contexts. 
4. A robot/android should only be as sexy as a 90s/2000s-era British character actor/actress. Any sexier and productivity suffers. Think Ralph Fiennes and/or Helena Bonham Carter. If you hit Kate Winslet and/or Jude Law, you fucked up; start over and ugly it up a bit.

You might be wondering, "what about drones? Can't drones kill people?" Of COURSE they can. If you need to murder someone, just use a drone and be done with it.

## Robot Types

### Good

A "Good" robot or android is friendly looking, with plenty of soft curves and soothing shapes. For Androids in particular, a certain soothing jerkiness and smooth facial features will help disspell the "uncanny valley" problem. 

[Robot saying] "I am happy to help you!"

### "Good"

From time to time, it will be necessary to introduce a robot that does suspect or even downright villainous activities. In that case, you will want to make the robot a little too obsequious at first and then more suspicious as time goes on. You'll also want to give them an unsettling voice and maybe a choppy, "New Wave" haircut. 

[Robot saying] "As you wish...master."


/// Virtual Crewmates



Virtual Crewmates (VCs) are typically hard-light constructs and appear in any hard-light capable environment. Use these guidelines to smooth the workflow of those who rely on Virtual Crewmates to function. 

## Visuals

A VC can be any gender, or totally genderless, depending on the designer's preference. The VC can have any body type or be non-human in appearance.

NOTE: Do not make the VC look like a naked lady with weird glowing eyes. It's sexist and, frankly, it's been done to death at this point. 

## Personality

VCs are capable of understanding complex human speech and can reply in kind. Use these modifiers to adjust your VC and better suit your real crewmates. 


| British | Percentage (0 - 100%) | Make your VC speak in a British accent, ranging from 0% (Dominic West doing his 'The Wire' Accent) to 100% (Ian McKellan playing King George VI, who is in turn playing Richard III) |
| Cheerful | Percentage (0 - 100%) | How bright and happy do you want your VC to be? 0% will yield a subdued, matter-of-fact voice; 100% will yield an almost frighteningly cheerful assistant, like a stewardess on an all-Mormon airline. |
| Direct | Boolean (True, False) | Choosing "True" will stop all interpersonal aspects of communication and yield the most direct, no-nonsense responses. |
| Haste | Percentage (0 - 100%) | Speeds up or slows down VC responses to questions. Standard is 60%. |
| Hostile | Multi-Choice (Yes, No, Mildly, Only to the poor, Only to people with insufficient permissions) | Choosing "Yes" will make the VC unwilling to cooperate with anyone; choosing "Only to the poor" and "Only to people with insufficient permissions" modes will enable what programmers call "Country Clubbing", in which people deemed "important" will be treated kindly and all others will be treated with disdain. |
| Manners | Scale(1-5) | Choosing "1" will enable a VC that burps and farts and calls each user "shitbird". Choosing "5" will yield a VC that obeys all societal niceties and always speaks respectfully. NOTE: A VC with level 5 manners will automatically be set to 95% British (the "Butler from *Downton Abbey*" setting). |
| Negativity | Percentage (0-100%) | VCs begin with a standard 33% negativity. Increasing toward 100% will drive the VC toward nihilism and make it uncooperative. Use cautiously. |
| Paul Rudd | Boolean (True,False) | A shortcut mode that makes the VC in question look, speak and interact like 20th and 21st-century actor Paul Rudd. His universal likability has not diminished one iota, making him an ideal virtual crew member. |
| Sarcasm | Scale (1-13) or "None" | VCs can be programmed to be more or less sarcastic, depending on their function. Please don't set them to thirteen, it makes them insufferable. Why did we even make thirteen an option? |
| Sensitivity | Scale (1-20) | Making VCs emotionally available can be beneficial in non-technical roles, such as medical work, psychiatric evaluations, grief counseling, and bartending. This modifier replaces "Sensuality" from the earliest deployments of VCore, which everyone used to make all the VCs overly sexy, which (as we already discussed) is gross. |
| Touchiness | Percentage (0 - 100%) | Setting this to 100 will make the VC pissy and unwilling to deal with you, as it will take everything you say about/to it as a personal attack. |
| Worrysome | Percentage (33 - 100%) | The lowest this can be is 33%, which is the default, as that is how anxious even the most steadfast humans are. Any more bravado and human crew members almost invariably hate the VC.|




// Heads-Up Displays (HUD)



Heads-up displays, or HUDs, appear in the user's personal field of vision. HUDs appear in a few common settings: 

- Vehicle windows
- Personal computing monocles
- Helmet interiors

HUDs can contain a wide variety of information, but rely on a few common principals to be effective: 

- The HUD must stay within the user's primary field of vision and cannot stress their peripheral vision
- The HUD must contain only the data most relevant to their current mission, task or trip
- The HUD must not occlude the user's vision entirely

Users may choose either the "Parallax" positioning standard (meaning the HUD shifts as the user's focus field shifts, such as when the user turns their head) or the "Fixed" positioning standard (The HUD stays static  no matter how the user's eye is positioned relative to it). Retinal tracking makes these different modes possible.

HUD use cases: 

Standard Vehicle HUD

** TK outline drawing of a vehicle interface **

Standard Personal HUD

** TK Biometric stats and phone calls and other horseshit **

Standard Helmet HUD

** TK Interior of a space helmet w/ hud info **




// Sequences




When showing a user a sequence of events or a countdown to a particular event, the following best practices are expected: 

## Diagram of sequence

"Show, Don't Tell" still applies in space. If, for instance, you are demonstrating a docking sequence, show a model of the vessels in question. Storyboard out a little walkthrough of what the procedures look like. Try and get it done in as few drawings as possible.

## Progress Bars

Everyone loves a progress bar, even when it's just bullshitting them into not terminating the process. Use a "barber pole" progress bar to show when a process has been interrupted or stalled. 

## Countdowns

Getting ready to self-destruct the station? Awesome! Don't forget to show the user how much time they have remaining, down to the nano-second. Countdown clocks should always display in HH:MM:SS:MsMs format.





// Weaponry


For centuries, the "user interface" of weapons was simple: pick up a weapon and use its simple machinery to kill something or someone. These days, weapons require more sophistication.

## Weapon modes

- Stun
- Kill
- EMP
- Flamethrower
- Regular Old Bullets (i.e., "Kill" but with significantly more clean-up)

## Standard weapon displays

Weapons should display to the user: 

- How much ammunition/battery charge remains
- How close the weapon is to overheating
- A brief start-up reminder that life is precious and weapons, even in stun mode, can be dangerous
- A visual icon of whatever power-up is currently in use for that weapon (spread-shot, power boost, freeze ray, etc.)



// Work Terminals



As users carry on with their workday aboard their space station, star cruiser, or even just at their old terrestrial standing desk, the Work Terminal is the most important screen in their world. 

A standard work terminal should include: 

- Email inbox
- Calendar
- Calculator
- Some spreadsheets
- A place to read and write documents
- An Exonet browser connection
- A little thingy that tells the user to get up and stretch once in a while
- Dropbox
- Forty screenshots of that problem IT refuses to adequately address
- Pictures of the user's kids, to remind them what the Hell they put themselves through this shit for
- Solitaire
- Duo-taire, a competitive version of Solitaire the user plays against that person the user has a crush on in Accounts Payable

In three hundred years, we still haven't come up with a better way to manage data than little graphic representations of files and folders. It's mind-boggling. If you figure out a better one, let us know, we're all ears.
